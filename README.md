# Organic Maps places list creator

[Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) is a map and navigation mobile app for Android and iOS based on OpenStreetMap.

Though not as polished as OsmAnd or Maps.me, it is precisely in its simplicity that its true value lies, hence no thousand layers, data tracking, ads, or other nuisances that you might find in other apps.
Also worthy of mention is the fact that you still get the ability to edit OSM through the app, as well as create and display lists of your own relevant spots for further consultation.

It is precisely on this last point that this program hinges, allowing you, from a given TXT or CSV file (see Template List TXT file for an example), to create your own lists from the convenience of a laptop computer.
Organic Maps even allows you to choose individual pin colors for each of your spots, namely:

Red, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Pink, Brown, Green, Orange, Deep Purple, Light Blue, Cyan, Teal, Lime, Deep Orange, Gray and Blue Gray.

So all you have to do is create a simple text file with the name, description (optional), coordinates (WGS84, get them from OSM or Google Maps, for example), and pin color for each place, run this program, and upload the resulting KML file to your phone so Organic Maps can find it and youâ€™re ready to head out on your journey!

To run this program, either run it through Windows Run, providing the path to your file as an argument, or simply create it in the same directory as the python script.
